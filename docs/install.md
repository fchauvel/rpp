# Install RPP

RPP is Javascript application that runs on top of
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Provided NodeJS is up and running on your machine, the simplest way to
install RPP is to use a Javascript package manager, such as Yarn or
NP.

```shell-session {highlight: [1]}
$ npm install --global @fchauvel/rpp
```

Alternatively, you can point directly to the Github repository, should
you want to benefit from the latest commits.

```shell-session {highlight: [1]}
$ npm install --global fchauvel/rpp#dev
```

<note>We point  to the `dev` branch, where most of the
development takes place.</note>
