# What is RPP?

RPP is a command line tool to help you with project management
activities, especially if&mdash;like me&mdash;you are not a project
manager ...

The idea is that RPP generate things you need to include in project
plan and reports, such as Gantt diagram, budgets, etc. from textual
description (YAML files).

RPP also helps you run sanity checks against your project descriptions
and helps you avoid inconsistencies, such task without contributors or
empty work packages to name a few. Here is an example of Gantt diagram
generated by RPP.

## Why not just use Ms Project?

It is probably a matter of taste, but I found such tools too
heavyweight for the very little time I would like to spend doing
management.
